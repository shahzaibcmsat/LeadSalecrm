# SendGrid Integration Guide

## ✅ SendGrid Email Integration Added!

Your FMD Companies CRM now supports **SendGrid** for sending emails from `info@pakistanlatest.news`!

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your SendGrid API Key

1. Log in to your SendGrid account: https://app.sendgrid.com/
2. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Give it a name (e.g., "FMD CRM")
5. Select **Full Access** or at minimum **Mail Send** permission
6. Click **Create & View**
7. **Copy the API key** (you'll only see it once!)

### 2. Update Your .env File

Open your `.env` file and replace `your-sendgrid-api-key-here` with your actual API key:

```env
# Email Provider Selection (sendgrid or microsoft)
EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid

# SendGrid Configuration
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  # ← Your actual key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=info@pakistanlatest.news
SENDGRID_FROM_NAME=FMD Companies
```

### 3. Verify Domain in SendGrid

Make sure `pakistanlatest.news` is verified in SendGrid:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Sender Authentication**
2. Click **Authenticate Your Domain**
3. Follow the DNS setup instructions
4. Wait for verification (usually a few minutes)

**Important**: SendGrid requires domain authentication to send emails. Without it, your emails may fail!

### 4. Start Your Server

```powershell
npm run dev
```

### 5. Test Email Sending

1. Open your CRM at http://localhost:5000
2. Go to **Leads** page
3. Click on a lead
4. Click **Send Email**
5. Write your message and send

The email will now be sent via **SendGrid** from `info@pakistanlatest.news`! ✉️

## 📊 Features

### Automatic Provider Selection

The system automatically uses the provider specified in `EMAIL_PROVIDER`:

- **sendgrid** - Uses SendGrid API (recommended)
- **microsoft** - Uses Microsoft Graph API (Outlook)

### Email Tracking

All emails sent via SendGrid are tracked in your database with:
- ✅ Message ID (from SendGrid)
- ✅ Conversation threading
- ✅ Sent/received status
- ✅ Full email history per lead

### Error Handling

If SendGrid fails, you'll see detailed error messages:
- Invalid API key
- Domain not verified
- Rate limits exceeded
- Email validation errors

## 🔄 Switching Between Providers

You can easily switch between SendGrid and Microsoft Graph:

**Use SendGrid:**
```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid
```

**Use Microsoft Graph:**
```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER=microsoft
```

No code changes needed - just update the .env file and restart!

## ✅ Configuration Check

Visit: http://localhost:5000/api/auth/status

You'll see:
```json
{
  "emailProvider": "sendgrid",
  "sendgrid": true,
  "environment": {
    "sendgridFromEmail": "info@pakistanlatest.news",
    "sendgridConfigured": true
  }
}
```
